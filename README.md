# Pandas in a Pickle
It is estimated that we make 35,000 decisions each day. Pandas in a Pickle is a choose your own adventure game celebrating the choices we make - simple and routine, large and life-shaping, as well as those about time, priorities, and how we treat others. 

Follow Pandora the panda on her way to the pickleball court where she's meeting her twin sister, Pansy. Along the way she has many decisions to make. Each action will cost some amount of time and influence her happiness, so choose wisely! Your goal is to get to the pickleball court on time and maximize happiness. Have fun!
